- **Intuition**: Use `prefix` and `suffix` arrays to calculate answer at each index. `prefix` is the product of all elements before `i` and `suffix` is the product of all elements after `i`.
- **Implementation**: Initialize `prefix` with `1` (before `i = 0` is just 1), iterate from `1 to n`, `prefix[i] = nums[i - 1] * prefix[i - 1]`. Initialize `suffix` with `suffix[-1] = 1` (after the end of the array, just 1 left), iterate backwards `n-2 to 0`, `suffix[i] = nums[i + 1] * suffix[i + 1]`. Answer is `ans[i] = prefix[i] * suffix[i]`
