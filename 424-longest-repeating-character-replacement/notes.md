- **Intuition**: Only 26 characters possible. In each window, the number of operations to make them all the same is the max frequency of the window minus the window length. Reduce the window until this condition is satisfied.
- **Implementation**: Create a frequency array (26 value array). Iterate with `r` pointer. Increment the character at `r` in the frequency array. Update the max frequency with the frequency value of the value at `r` (new value added). If the number of operations (`windowLen - maxFreq`) is greater than `k`, increment l (reduce window size) and decrement the frequency value.
- **Edge-cases**: Window size is calculated with `r - l + 1`.
- **Complexity**: Time `O(n)`, Space `O(1)` (freq is 26 values, const.)
