- **Intuition**: Use a similar approach to [Two Sum II - Input Array Sorted](../167-two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/solution.py), sort the input, look for when left and right of the right side of the array add up to the current number
- **Implementation**: Sort the input `O(n log n)`, for each number, binary search on the right side of the array, if `l + r = curr`, triplet found, add to result, move right if `l + r` is too big, otherwise move left
- **Edge-cases**: Ensure that we keep going even after finding a triplet because there could be more with the same `curr`. Also ensure that we move past duplicates for `curr` because it will be the same result, i.e. if we have [-1, -1, -1, 0, 1], we want to start processing at the last -1. Same thing when we find an answer, we want to move left and right until they are at the next non-duplicate
