- **Intuition**: Use ladders for the largest jumps.
- **Implementation**: Use a max heap. Iterate over pairs and calculate difference. If difference <= 0, continue. Otherwise, assume we will use bricks and decrement the bricks by the difference. Add the difference to the max heap. If the bricks go below 0, we must use a ladder. If ladders are equal to zero here, return the current index. Otherwise, decrement ladders and add back the max value in the heap to the bricks (effectively switching the largest jump we've seen to ladders instead of bricks). If iteration completes, return the last index.
- **Complexity**: Time `O(n log n)`, Space `O(n)` (heap)
