- **Intuition**: To find a valid answer we simply need to find if the complement (`target - curr`) exists in the array
- **Implementation**: Use a hashmap to store numbers with their indices (allow overwrites because duplicates are not allowed), check if the complement exists in the map and is not the same number, return
- **Edge-cases**: Ensure that you check the indices are not the same when returning (i.e. `map[complement] != i`)
- **Complexity**: Time `O(n)`, Space `O(n)` (hashmap)
