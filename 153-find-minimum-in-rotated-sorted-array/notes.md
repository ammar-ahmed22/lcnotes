- **Intuition**: The number before and after the min will be greater than it.
- **Implementation**: Binary search, check for number before and after being greater as stop condition. Move towards the smaller value out of right and left.
- **Edge-cases**: Also check if the mid value is zero and end of array in stop condition check to mitigate out of bound errors.
- **Complexity**: Time `O(log n)`, Space `O(1)`
