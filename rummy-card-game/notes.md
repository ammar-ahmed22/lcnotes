- **Intuition**: Group cards by rank and suit and then generate sets from same rank cards and sets from same suit cards.
- **Implementation**: Start off by grouping cards by rank and suit in hash maps. For the sets, iterate over the rank map and ignore any ranks that have fewer than 3 cards. If they have >= 3 cards, iterate from 3 to the length of the cards + 1 and genrate combinations of those cards for each iteration. 3, 4, 5, so on. add that to result. For the sets, iterate over the suit map, ignore suits that have fewer than 3 cards. Extract the cards and sort them by suit. Iterate through and generate segments of consecutive cards. If you get to a point that it no longer consecutive, check if the current segments is greater than 3 and slide window across of size 3+, adding to result. Then, reset the segments to the current value to continue. At the end, there may be one more segment left so do the same.
- **Complexity**: Time `O(n^2)` (because of the set algo, very small n so ok), Space `O(n^2)`
