- **Intuition**: The start of a sequence is when there IS a number exactly 1 greater than it in the array and NOT a number exactly 1 less than it. When a sequence start is found, iterate looking for the next values, keeping track of the max length
- **Implementation**: Use hashmap to store all numbers for `O(1)` lookup, iterate and look for sequence start, iterate building the sequence and keep track of max
- **Edge-cases**: In case of duplicates, we don't process the same sequence start multiple times. Initialize hashmap with all `False` values, when processing a sequence start, mark it as `True` to signify this sequence start is already processed and don't process that sequence start again
