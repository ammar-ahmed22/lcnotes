- **Intuition**: Use two pointers with a write pointer.
- **Implementation**: Initialize two pointers, `l` and `r` to zero as well as a write pointer, `k` to zero. Iterate while `r` is less than the length of the character array. Inside the iteration, iterate again while `r` is the same as `l` and increment `r`. After this iteration, `r` will be moved to the first non-repeating character so the difference between `r` and `l` is how many repeating characters we saw. Start off by writing the character at `l` to the array using the write pointer `k` (`chars[k] = chars[l]`). Then increment `k`. After this, check if `r - l` is greater than 1, iterate over the characters of the number and write them to the character array, iterating `k` each time. After this, set `l = r` to continue with the next set of characters. At the end, `k` will be at the end of our modified characters so it can be returned.
- **Complexity**: Time `O(n)`, Space `O(1)`
