- **Intuition**: Recursively generate by going down the different possible paths to make a well-formed parentheses set. Open and closed must both equal n for it to be well-formed
- **Implementation**: Recursive function that takes open, closed, n, stack and result. Base case `open == close == n`, form the string from the stack and add to result. Otherwise, check if `open < n`, add open to stack, recurse with new count, pop from stack after to go down other path. Check if `closed < open` (other path), add close to stack, recurse with new count, pop from stack.
