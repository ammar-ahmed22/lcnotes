- **Intuition**: Add characters alternately from each string, ensuring to add remaining characters at the end.
- **Implementation**: Initialize pointers for each word (`i, j`) and a counter variable for the resultant string (`k`). Iterate while `i < len(word1)` and `j < len(word2)` so that it will stop when any one of them goes out of bounds . On each iteration, check if `k % 2 == 0`, if it is, add the character from `word1` to the result and increment `i`, otherwise, add the character from `word2` and increment `j`. Always increment `k`. After the initial iteration, iterate while `i < len(word1)` and add the characters and the same thing for j and word2 to add any remaining characters if the strings are unequal length.
- **Complexity**: Time `O(n + m)` where `n` is the length of `word1` and `m` is the length of `word2`, Space `O(1)`
