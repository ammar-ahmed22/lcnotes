## Problems Solved
| Problem | Notes | Difficulty | Solution |
| :-----: | ----- | :--------: | :------: |
| [84. Largest Rectangle in Histogram](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-rectangle-in-histogram) | - **Intuition**: We only want to increase the width when we find a taller line that can potentially form a larger area with a previous line.<br />- **Implementation**: Use a stack and keep track of max area. Stack will store indices of the lines. Iterate from 0 to n + 1. curr is the current height or 0. If current is less than the top of the stack, pop from stack as our height and calculate area with the smaller height before it (top of stack after popping). Update max area. Push current index to stack.<br />- **Edge-cases**: When stack is empty after popping, the left index can be set to -1 to calculate width correctly.<br />- **Complexity**: Time `O(n)`, Space `O(n)` (stack)<br /> | ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Hard-red?style=flat) | [solution](./84-largest-rectangle-in-histogram/solution.py)
| [76. Minimum Window Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring) | - **Intuition**: Frequency map created with chars of `t`, substring will be valid if when substracting frequencies from the same map are all less than or equal to zero.<br />- **Implementation**: Create a frequency map of all characters in `t`. The minimum window size will be of length `t`, start `r` there. Process the first window first by iteration from `0` to `r` and subtracting from the map if the character exists. Iterate while `r` is less than `s`. Check if the current substring is valid by checking if the map has all `<= 0`. If it is valid, update the minimum string if needed. Always reduce the window when valid by incrementing `l` and updating the map. Only increment `r` when it's invalid or the length of the window has reached the minimum length (`len(t)`).<br />- **Edge-cases**: When incrementing `r`, the frequency map should be updated AFTER. When incrementing `l`, frequency map should be updated BEFORE. Aeeswer is initialized to `""` so check for that as well (see solution).<br />- **Complexity**: Time `O(m)` (sliding window across `s`), Space `O(n)` (hashmap for `t`), where `m` is the length of `s` and `n` is the length of `t`.<br /> | ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Hard-red?style=flat) | [solution](./76-minimum-window-substring/solution.py)

| [347. Top K Frequent Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements) | - **Intuition**: We can use an array that maps index to frequency (i.e. freq[1] = 2 means 2 has a frequency of 1), allowing us to formulate the answer in `O(n)` time<br />- **Implementation**: Use a hashmap to count frequencies, iterate over hashmap and create our frequency array (length `n + 1`, 1-based indexing), iterate backwards over frequency array to create result<br />- **Edge-cases**: Multiple elements can have the same frequency so frequency array should be an array of arrays, when iterating backwards go into arrays if needed<br />- **Complexity**: Time `O(n)`, Space `O(n)` (freq map)<br /> | ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Medium-orange?style=flat) | [solution](./347-top-k-frequent-elements/solution.py)
| [238. Product of Array Except Self](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self) | - **Intuition**: Use `prefix` and `suffix` arrays to calculate answer at each index. `prefix` is the product of all elements before `i` and `suffix` is the product of all elements after `i`.<br />- **Implementation**: Initialize `prefix` with `1` (before `i = 0` is just 1), iterate from `1 to n`, `prefix[i] = nums[i - 1] * prefix[i - 1]`. Initialize `suffix` with `suffix[-1] = 1` (after the end of the array, just 1 left), iterate backwards `n-2 to 0`, `suffix[i] = nums[i + 1] * suffix[i + 1]`. Answer is `ans[i] = prefix[i] * suffix[i]`<br />- **Complexity**: Time `O(n)`, Space `O(n)` (prefix and suffix arrays)<br /> | ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Medium-orange?style=flat) | [solution](./238-product-of-array-except-self/solution.py)
| [36. Valid Sudoku](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-sudoku) | - **Intuition**: Check each row, column and 3x3 subbox for duplicates essentially<br />- **Implementation**: Use a hashmap to check for duplicates in each row, column and 3x3 subbox<br />- **Edge-cases**: Figuring out the indexing of the 3x3 subbox is difficult. Do 4 nested loops, `box_row (0 to 3)`, `box_col (0 to 3)`, `row (0 to 3)`, `col (0 to 3)`, then we can access the specific value with `board[3 * box_row + row][3  * box_col + col]`<br />- **Complexity**: Time `O(n^2)`, Space `O(1)`<br /> | ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Medium-orange?style=flat) | [solution](./36-valid-sudoku/solution.py)
| [128. Longest Consecutive Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence) | - **Intuition**: The start of a sequence is when there IS a number exactly 1 greater than it in the array and NOT a number exactly 1 less than it. When a sequence start is found, iterate looking for the next values, keeping track of the max length<br />- **Implementation**: Use hashmap to store all numbers for `O(1)` lookup, iterate and look for sequence start, iterate building the sequence and keep track of max<br />- **Edge-cases**: In case of duplicates, we don't process the same sequence start multiple times. Initialize hashmap with all `False` values, when processing a sequence start, mark it as `True` to signify this sequence start is already processed and don't process that sequence start again<br />- **Complexity**: Time `O(n)`, Space `O(n)` (hashmap)<br /> | ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Medium-orange?style=flat) | [solution](./128-longest-consecutive-sequence/solution.py)
| [167. Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted) | - **Intuition**: Since array is sorted, we only need to look for our complment (`target - curr`) in the values to the right of the current (also sorted, binary search)<br />- **Implementation**: For each number, calculate the complement, conduct binary search on the elements to the right of it, if not found keep going, if found return<br />- **Complexity**: Time `O(log n)`, Space `O(1)`<br /><br /> | ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Medium-orange?style=flat) | [solution](./167-two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/solution.py)
| [15. 3Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum) | - **Intuition**: Use a similar approach to [Two Sum II - Input Array Sorted](../167-two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/solution.py), sort the input, look for when left and right of the right side of the array add up to the current number<br />- **Implementation**: Sort the input `O(n log n)`, for each number, binary search on the right side of the array, if `l + r = curr`, triplet found, add to result, move right if `l + r` is too big, otherwise move left<br />- **Edge-cases**: Ensure that we keep going even after finding a triplet because there could be more with the same `curr`. Also ensure that we move past duplicates for `curr` because it will be the same result, i.e. if we have [-1, -1, -1, 0, 1], we want to start processing at the last -1. Same thing when we find an answer, we want to move left and right until they are at the next non-duplicate<br />- **Complexity**: Time `O(n^2 log n)` (sorting, nested loop), Space `O(1)`<br /> | ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Medium-orange?style=flat) | [solution](./15-3sum/solution.py)
| [11. Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water) | - **Intuition**: We want to maximize height and width. Start with max width and always reduce the width towards the larger height.<br />- **Implementation**: Left and right pointers at the end of the array. Keep track of max area using min of left and right as height. Move right or left pointer towards the larger one. i.e. if left > right, move right. if right > left, move left.<br />- **Complexity**: Time `O(n)`, Space `O(1)`<br /> | ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Medium-orange?style=flat) | [solution](./11-container-with-most-water/solution.py)

Min Stack](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-stack) | - **Intuition**: Use two stacks, one to track the min values and one for the actual stack<br />- **Implementation**: Initialize two stacks. `getMin` gets the top of the min stack if it has elements, otherwise top of main stack. `top` gets the top of the main stack always. `push` will always push to main stack, checks if the number is less than or equal to the min or if the stack is empty and pushes to the min stack, `pop` will check if the current top is equal to the min, pop from min stack, always pop from main stack after.<br />- **Complexity**: Time `O(1)` for `getMin`, Space `O(n)` (stack)<br /> | ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Medium-orange?style=flat) | [solution](./155-min-stack/solution.py)
| [150. Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation](https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-reverse-polish-notation) | - **Intuition**: In RPN, every operator operates on the last two elements while ensuring the results of all operations are continously updated.<br />- **Implementation**: Use a stack, whenever a number is seen, add to stack. When an operator seen, pop the last 2 and operate on them, push the result back to the stack and keep going. Return top of stack at the end.<br />- **Edge-cases**: In Python, integer division (`a // b`) does not truncate to zero, use `int(b / a)`. Remember order for division and subtraction matter, its `b - a` and `int(b / a)`.<br />- **Complexity**: Time `O(n)`, Space `O(n)` (stack)<br /> | ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Medium-orange?style=flat) | [solution](./150-evaluate-reverse-polish-notation/solution.py)

Generate Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/generate-parentheses) | - **Intuition**: Recursively generate by going down the different possible paths to make a well-formed parentheses set. Open and closed must both equal n for it to be well-formed<br />- **Implementation**: Recursive function that takes open, closed, n, stack and result. Base case `open == close == n`, form the string from the stack and add to result. Otherwise, check if `open < n`, add open to stack, recurse with new count, pop from stack after to go down other path. Check if `closed < open` (other path), add close to stack, recurse with new count, pop from stack.<br />- **Complexity**: Time is complex, something to do with the n-th Catalan number: `O(1 / (n + 1) * 2nCn * n)`, Space `O(n)` (call stack)<br /> | ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Medium-orange?style=flat) | [solution](./22-generate-parentheses/solution.py)

Iterate while `fast` and `fast.next` is not `None`. Update `slow` with `slow.next` and update `fast` with `fast.next.next`. After updating, if `fast == slow`, cycle found, early return `True`. Otherwise, if iteration completes (no cycle), return `False`.<br />- **Complexity**: Time `O(n)`, Space `O(1)`<br /> | ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Easy-green?style=flat) | [solution](./141-linked-list-cycle/solution.py)

Maximum Depth of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree) | - **Intuition**: DFS on the tree taking the max of left and right, increasing depth count each time.<br />- **Implementation**: Create a `dfs` recursive function that takes in the `root` and the `depth`. Base case, `root` is `None`, return `depth`. Otherwise, recursve with max of the `dfs` call on the left and the right with `depth + 1`.<br />- **Complexity**: Time `O(n)`, Space `O(n)` (recursive call stack)<br /> | ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Easy-green?style=flat) | [solution](./104-maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/solution.py)

Diameter of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree) | - **Intuition**: The maximum of the heights through any given node will be the diameter.<br />- **Implementation**: Use DFS. The recursive function will calculate the height of the tree as well as update a global `res` value for the answer. Base case is if `root` is `None`, return `0`. Otherwise, `dfs` on `left` and `right`. Update global `res` with max of left and right calculation. Recurse with `1 + max(left, right)`.<br />- **Edge-cases**: In Python, variable scoped outside of the closure must be initialized inside it with `nonlocal` keyword (see solution).<br />- **Complexity**: Time `O(n)`, Space `O(n)` (call stack)<br /> | ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Easy-green?style=flat) | [solution](./543-diameter-of-binary-tree/solution.py)

## Overview
lcnotes is a personal CLI that helps me manage LeetCode problems locally. It can:
- Create a structured workspace for a problem (scraped metadata, starter code, docs, tests)
- Run or test solutions
- Track problems in a local problems.json
- Curate a README of published problems with notes and tags

### How it works (high level)
- Scraping: Uses Playwright to fetch title, difficulty, statement HTML, and Python starter code from LeetCode.
- Storage: problems.json tracks id, title, directory, difficulty, tags, notes, published.
- Templating: Jinja2 templates render docs and the top-level README.
- UX: Interactive fuzzy prompts for selecting problems; spinners for progress; consistent error handling.

### Per-problem layout
```text path=null start=null
<number>-<slug>/
  docs.md        # scraped problem statement (Markdown)
  notes.md       # personal notes; used when publishing
  solution.py    # starter code scaffold
  tests.py       # pytest tests scaffold
```

## Commands
Below are the CLI commands and what they do. If a slug is omitted or ambiguous, a fuzzy prompt lets me pick.

### add
Create a new workspace from a LeetCode slug.
- Fetch metadata (with spinner and retry), e.g. title, difficulty, statement, starter code
- Create the directory and files (docs.md, notes.md, solution.py, tests.py)
- Populate files from templates
- Add a base entry to problems.json

Usage:
```bash path=null start=null
lc add <problem-slug>
```

### run
Run solution.py for a problem (no tests; just executes the script).

Usage:
```bash path=null start=null
lc run [partial-slug]
```
- If not found or ambiguous, prompts to select a problem
- Executes: python3 <dir>/solution.py and prints stdout; exits non-zero on error

### test
Run pytest tests for a problem.

Usage:
```bash path=null start=null
lc test [partial-slug]
```
- Runs: python3 -m pytest <dir>/tests.py
- Prints results; exits non-zero if tests fail or errors occur

### remove
Remove a problem and its workspace.

Usage:
```bash path=null start=null
lc remove [partial-slug]
```
- Deletes the problem directory and removes it from problems.json
- Regenerates README to reflect the change

### publish
Mark a problem as published and update README. Prompts to add tags and pulls notes from notes.md.

Usage:
```bash path=null start=null
lc publish <slug>
# or publish all unpublished
lc publish --all
```
- Sets published=true, attaches notes and tags, updates README and problems.json

### unpublish
Unpublish a problem (clears notes and tags, removes from README listing).

Usage:
```bash path=null start=null
lc unpublish <slug>
```
- Sets published=false, clears notes/tags, updates README and problems.json

### generate-readme
Regenerate the top-level README from current published problems.

Usage:
```bash path=null start=null
lc generate-readme
```

## Notes
- The README shows only published problems and sorts them by difficulty.
- Fuzzy selection uses InquirerPy; spinners use yaspin.
- The scraper opens LeetCode in headless Chromium and extracts the Python3 starter.
- Tags and notes are stored in problems.json and rendered into the README when published.
