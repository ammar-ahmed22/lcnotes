- **Intuition**: Iterate the lists together, smaller ones going in first.
- **Implementation**: Pointers for `list1`, `l1` and `list2`, `l2`. Create a dummy node for the result, set the `curr` pointer to the dummy. Iterate while `l1` and `l2` are not `None`. If `l1` value is less than `l2` val, set `curr.next` to a new node with that value. Update the curr pointer and the `l1` pointer. Else, set `curr.next` to a new node with that value. Update the curr pointer and the `l2` pointer. After the first iteration completes, one of `l1` or `l2` might still be not fully complete. Iterate through both of them the same way as above to finish it off. Return `dummy.next`.
- **Complexity**: Time `O(m + n)` where `m` is length of `list1` and `n` is the length of `list2`, Space `O(1)`
